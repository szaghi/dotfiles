# Research Information Lookup

## Overview

This skill provides real-time research information lookup through the **Parallel Chat API** (`core` model): comprehensive, multi-source research reports with inline citations via the OpenAI-compatible Chat API at `https://api.parallel.ai`. Every query, general or academic, goes to this one backend.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need:

- **Current Research Information**: Latest studies, papers, and findings
- **Literature Verification**: Check facts, statistics, or claims against current research
- **Background Research**: Gather context and supporting evidence for scientific writing
- **Citation Sources**: Find relevant papers and studies to cite
- **Technical Documentation**: Look up specifications, protocols, or methodologies
- **Market/Industry Data**: Current statistics, trends, competitive intelligence
- **Recent Developments**: Emerging trends, breakthroughs, announcements

## Visual Enhancement with Scientific Schematics

**When creating documents with this skill, always consider adding scientific diagrams and schematics to enhance visual communication.**

If your document does not already contain schematics or diagrams:
- Use the **scientific-schematics** skill to generate AI-powered publication-quality diagrams
- Simply describe your desired diagram in natural language

```bash
python scripts/generate_schematic.py "your diagram description" -o figures/output.png
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. General Research Queries

Comprehensive, multi-source research with citations via the Chat API (`core` model).

```
Query Examples:
- "Recent advances in CRISPR gene editing 2025"
- "Compare mRNA vaccines vs traditional vaccines for cancer treatment"
- "AI adoption in healthcare industry statistics"
- "Global renewable energy market trends and projections"
- "Explain the mechanism underlying gut microbiome and depression"
```

**Response includes:**
- Comprehensive research report in markdown
- Inline citations from authoritative web sources
- Structured sections with key findings
- Multiple perspectives and data points
- Source URLs for verification

### 2. Academic Paper Search

Phrase the query to ask for scholarly, peer-reviewed sources explicitly; DOIs and academic URLs in the report are extracted into the `Additional References` section.

```
Query Examples:
- "Find papers on transformer attention mechanisms in NeurIPS 2024"
- "Foundational papers on quantum error correction"
- "Systematic review of immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer"
- "Cite the original BERT paper and its most influential follow-ups"
- "Published studies on CRISPR off-target effects in clinical trials"
```

**Response includes:**
- Summary of key findings from academic literature
- Citations with authors, titles, journals, years, and DOIs where the report provides them
- Key statistics and methodology highlights
- Research gaps and future directions

### 3. Technical and Methodological Information

```
Query Examples:
- "Western blot protocol for protein detection"
- "Statistical power analysis for clinical trials"
- "Machine learning model evaluation metrics comparison"
```

### 4. Statistical and Market Data

```
Query Examples:
- "Prevalence of diabetes in US population 2025"
- "Global AI market size and growth projections"
- "COVID-19 vaccination rates by country"
```

```

## MANDATORY: Save All Results to Sources Folder

**Every research-lookup result MUST be saved to the project's `sources/` folder.**

This is non-negotiable. Research results are expensive to obtain and critical for reproducibility.

### Saving Rules

| Query type | `-o` Flag Target | Filename Pattern |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| General research | `sources/research_<topic>.md` | `research_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<brief_topic>.md` |
| Paper search | `sources/papers_<topic>.md` | `papers_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<brief_topic>.md` |
| Batch queries | `sources/batch_<topic>.md` | `batch_research_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<brief_topic>.md` |

### How to Save

**CRITICAL: Every call to `research_lookup.py` MUST include the `-o` flag pointing to the `sources/` folder.**

**CRITICAL: Saved files MUST preserve all citations, source URLs, and DOIs.** The default text output automatically includes a `Sources` section (with title, date, URL for each source) and an `Additional References` section (with DOIs and academic URLs extracted from the response text). For maximum citation metadata, use `--json`.

```bash
# General research — save to sources/ (includes Sources + Additional References sections)
python research_lookup.py "Recent advances in CRISPR gene editing 2025" \
  -o sources/research_20250217_143000_crispr_advances.md

# Academic paper search — save to sources/ (includes paper citations with DOIs)
python research_lookup.py "Find papers on transformer attention mechanisms in NeurIPS 2024" \
  -o sources/papers_20250217_143500_transformer_attention.md

# JSON format for maximum citation metadata (full citation objects with URLs, DOIs, snippets)
python research_lookup.py "CRISPR clinical trials" --json \
  -o sources/research_20250217_143000_crispr_trials.json

# Batch queries — save to sources/
python research_lookup.py --batch "mRNA vaccines efficacy" "mRNA vaccines safety" \
  -o sources/batch_research_20250217_144500_mrna_vaccines.md
```

### Citation Preservation in Saved Files

Each output format preserves citations differently:

| Format | Citations Included | When to Use |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| Text (default) | `Sources (N):` section with `[title] (date) + URL` + `Additional References (N):` with DOIs and academic URLs | Standard use — human-readable with all citations |
| JSON (`--json`) | Full citation objects: `url`, `title`, `date`, `snippet`, `doi`, `type` | When you need maximum citation metadata |

Saved files include: research report + Sources list (title, URL) + Additional References (DOIs, academic URLs).

**Use `--json` when you need to:**
- Parse citation metadata programmatically
- Preserve full DOI and URL data for BibTeX generation
- Maintain the structured citation objects for cross-referencing

### Why Save Everything

1. **Reproducibility**: Every citation and claim can be traced back to its raw research source
2. **Context Window Recovery**: If context is compacted, saved results can be re-read without re-querying
3. **Audit Trail**: The `sources/` folder documents exactly how all research information was gathered
4. **Reuse Across Sections**: Multiple sections can reference the same saved research without duplicate queries
5. **Cost Efficiency**: Check `sources/` for existing results before making new API calls
6. **Peer Review Support**: Reviewers can verify the research backing every citation

### Before Making a New Query, Check Sources First

Before calling `research_lookup.py`, check if a relevant result already exists:

```bash
ls sources/  # Check existing saved results
```

If a prior lookup covers the same topic, re-read the saved file instead of making a new API call.

### Logging

When saving research results, always log:

```
[HH:MM:SS] SAVED: Research lookup to sources/research_20250217_143000_crispr_advances.md (3,800 words, 8 citations)
[HH:MM:SS] SAVED: Paper search to sources/papers_20250217_143500_transformer_attention.md (6 papers found)
```

1. **Literature Review Support**: Gather current research for introduction and discussion — **save to `sources/`**
2. **Methods Validation**: Verify protocols against current standards — **save to `sources/`**
3. **Results Contextualization**: Compare findings with recent similar studies — **save to `sources/`**
4. **Discussion Enhancement**: Support arguments with latest evidence — **save to `sources/`**
5. **Citation Management**: Provide properly formatted citations — **save to `sources/`**

## Error Handling and Limitations

**Known Limitations:**
- Parallel Chat API (core model): Complex queries may take up to 5 minutes
- May not access full text behind paywalls
- Cannot access proprietary or restricted databases

**Error Behavior:**
- If `PARALLEL_API_KEY` is missing, exits with an error before any request
- If the API call fails, returns a structured error response (`success: false`, `error`)
- Rephrase queries for better results if initial response is insufficient
